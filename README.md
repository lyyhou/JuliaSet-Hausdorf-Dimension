Abstract: 

If a function \(f\) is holomorphic such that \( f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}\), where \(\mathbb{C} \subseteq \hat{\mathbb{C}},\) and \(\hat{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C} \cup \{\infty\}\), (Riemann Sphere) then there exists a set defined to be Julia such that

and its Hausdorff dimension contains a known bound if in the logistic family. A detailed analysis was performed using bounding maps that are considered an extension of commonly known sets, with all residing outside of the quadratic family 

![Quadratic Family](https://math.now.sh?from=f_c(z)%20%3D%20z%5E2%20%2B%20c).

We present a Hausdorff dimension bound, along with further topological inferences relating to connectivity and density. The applications of this include a deeper innate understanding of logical Hilbert subspace characterization.
