Abstract: 

If a function \(f\) is holomorphic such that \( f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}\), where \(\mathbb{C} \subseteq \hat{\mathbb{C}},\) and \(\hat{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C} \cup \{\infty\}\), (Riemann Sphere) then there exists a set defined to be Julia such that 

\[
J(f) = \partial\{z \in \mathbb{C} : \limsup_{n \to \infty}|f^{(n)}(z)| < \infty \}
\]

and its Hausdorff dimension contains a known bound if in the logistic family. A detailed analysis was performed using bounding maps that are considered an extension of commonly known sets, with all residing outside of the quadratic family \(f_c(z) = z^2 + c\). We present a Hausdorff dimension bound, along with further topological inferences relating to connectivity and density. The applications of this include a deeper innate understanding of logical Hilbert subspace characterization.
