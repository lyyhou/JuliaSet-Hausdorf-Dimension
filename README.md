Abstract: 

If a function ![Function Mapping](https://math.now.sh?from=f%3A%20%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%20%5Cto%20%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D), where ![Complex Subset](https://math.now.sh?from=%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%20%5Csubseteq%20%5Chat%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%7D) and ![Riemann Sphere](https://math.now.sh?from=%5Chat%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%20%5Ccup%20%5C%7B%5Cinfty%5C%7D) (Riemann Sphere), then there exists a set defined to be Julia such that:

![Julia Set](https://math.now.sh?from=J(f)%20%3D%20%5Cpartial%5C%7Bz%20%5Cin%20%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%20%3A%20%5Climsup_%7Bn%20%5Cto%20%5Cinfty%7D%7Cf%5E%7B(n)%7D(z)%7C%20%3C%20%5Cinfty%20%5C%7D)

and its Hausdorff dimension contains a known bound if in the logistic family. A detailed analysis was performed using bounding maps that are considered an extension of commonly known sets, with all residing outside of the quadratic family: ![Quadratic Family](https://math.now.sh?from=f_c(z)%20%3D%20z%5E2%20%2B%20c). We present a Hausdorff dimension bound, along with further topological inferences relating to connectivity and density. The applications of this include a deeper innate understanding of logical Hilbert subspace characterization.
